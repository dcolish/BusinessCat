The Business Cat Brief
=========================

Let's make OLAP into NOLAP!


The Complaint
-------------

Running your business is hard, making reports shouldn't be. Yet, it looks like
an entire industry is stacked against that one goal. The business reporting
industry is one of buzzwordiest, consultatious sectors in the software
market. For the priviledge of seeing how many widgets you've sold, you will pay
a for a lifetime. The culture of consultantware thrives on this model. Its
really quite simple to execute:

- Identify a sector of business that is critical but possibly mundane,
- Design software that is infinitely configurable,
- Spend a lot of time marketing this software as free,
- Send in sales consultants to show a fancy demo,
- Actually write the software as quickly as possible,
- Rake in the cash with support contracts and enterprise licensing.

You see, by spending development money on marketing and then offering consulting
and support, a company can appear quite competent when, in fact, their core
product is a turd. The true genius of this trick is to convince the business
owners said product is working splendidly and keep the workers who actually deal
with it quiet about the truth; `FUD`_ works best there.

Of course, there really doesn't exist an alternative. You might really wonder
why no one has started a completely open source project to fill this need? The
truth is that some have, and some are quite good, but also quite
complicated. The current open source alternative is attempting to directly
compete with the big boys. The problem is that their projects are flawed by the
same design philosophy. I want a reset.
